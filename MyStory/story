Once upon a time in a forest, 
there lived a monkey who rested on a berry tree,
which was on the bank of a river.
In the same forest, 
there lived a Crocodile and his wife.
One day the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested underneath the tree.
The kindhearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile saw his opportunity.
